Short description of the DLL functions supported in Double Dummy Problem Solver 1.1


extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) int __stdcall SolveBoard(struct deal, int target,  
    int solutions,  int mode, struct futureTricks *futp);

/* Before SolveBoard can be called, a structure of type "futureTricks" must be declared. 

SolveBoard returns a status integer, "no fault" means the DLL supplies the trick data in the
"futureTricks" type structure.
Status codes:   
   1=No fault, 
  -1=Unknown fault, 
  -2=No of cards = 0, 
  -3=target > Number of tricks left,                         
  -4=Duplicated cards, 
  -5=target < -1, 
  -7=target >13, 
  -8=solutions < 1, 
  -9=solutions > 3, 
-10=No of cards > 52
-11=Not used
-12=Suit or rank value out of range for deal.currentTrickSuit or deal.currentTrickRank.
  
Structure ”deal” defines all data needed to describe the deal to be analyzed.
struct deal { 
   int trump;   /* I.e. which suit that is trump or if contract is NT, Spades=0, Hearts=1, 
                         Diamonds=2, Clubs=3,  NT=4 */ 
   int first;      /* 0-3, 0=North, 1=East, 2=South, 3=West , Leading hand for the trick.*/ 
    int currentTrickSuit[3];  /* 0-3 for up to 3 cards in the order played */
   int currentTrickRank[3];  /* 2-14 for up to 3 cards */
   unsigned int remainCards[4][4]; /* 1st index hand (0-3), 2nd index suit (0-3), values as bitstring of ranks
 				    bit 0=0, bit 1=0, bit 2=rank 2, ………. bit 14=rank 14, bit 15=0
    for cards remaining after already played cards (cards already 
    played to the current trick are not included in this bitstring).  
    The decimal value for a card then range between 4 (=rank 2) and 
   16384  (Ace=rank 14). */ 
}; 

Parameter ”target” is the number of tricks to be won by the side to play, -1 means that the program 
shall find the maximum number. For equivalent  cards only the highest is returned. 

Parameter ”solutions” defines how many card solutions that SolveBoard must return:
  target=1-13, solutions=1:  Returns only one of the cards. Its returned score is the same as target when 
                                          target or higher tricks can be won. Otherwise, score –1 is returned if target 
                                          cannot be reached, or score 0 if no tricks can be won. 
  target=-1, solutions=1:  Returns only one of the optimum cards and its score.
  target=0, solutions=1:  Returns only one of the cards legal to play with score set to 0.
  target 1-13, solutions=2:  Return all cards meeting target. Their returned scores are the same as
                                         target when target or higher tricks can be won. Otherwise, only one card 
                                         is returned with score –1 if target cannot be reached, or score 0 for all cards 
                                         legal to play if no tricks can be won.
  target –1, solutions=2:  Return all optimum cards with their scores.
  target=0, solutions=2:  Return all cards legal to play with scores set to 0.
  target irrelevant, solutions=3:  Return all cards that can be legally played with their scores in 
                                                  descending  order.

Parameter ”mode” defines the DLL mode of operation. This mode does not affect the DLL if there are multiple choices for cards to play. If there is just one card to play, or multiple cards that are all 
equivalent, this mode determines  whether or not the DLL will search to find the score.
  mode=0:  Do not search to find the score if the hand to play has only one card, including its equivalents, 
                  to play. Score is set to –2 for this card, indicating that there are no alternative cards. This mode 
                  is very fast but you don’t 
  mode=1:  Always search to find the score. Even when the hand to play has only one card,  with possible
                 equivalents, to play.
  mode=2:  As for mode=1, but the transposition table contents is reused from the preceding SolveBoard
                  call. Deal must be the same, except for deal.first.
                  Example:
                  1st call:  SolveBoard(deal, -1, 1, 1, &fut),  deal.first=1, i.e. East leads.
                  2nd call:  SolveBoard(deal, -1, 1, 2, &fut),  deal.first=2, i.e. South leads.
                  3rd call:  SolveBoard(deal, -1, 1, 2, &fut),  deal.first=3, i.e. West leads. 
                  4th call:  SolveBoard(deal, -1, 1, 2, &fut),  deal.first=0, i.e. North leads.   

struct futureTricks { /* The DLL provides the score (number of tricks) that can be won by the card to 
	                 play defined by its suit and rank. Array of all alternative cards. */ 
  int nodes;     /* Number of searched nodes */
  int cards;         /*  No of alternative cards  */
  int suit[13];         /* 0=Spades, 1=Hearts, 2=Diamonds, 3=Clubs */
  int rank[13];        /* 2-14 for 2 through Ace */ 
  int equals[13];        /* Bitstring of ranks for equivalent lower rank cards. 
       The decimal value range between 4 (=2) and 8192 (King=rank 13).  When there
       are several ”equals”, the value is the sum of each ”equal”. */
  int score[13];     /* -1 indicates that target was not reached, otherwise target or max number 
                             of tricks */ 
} ;
