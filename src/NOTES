Makefile
- One for each system
- Clean define's, WE control what gets compiled, not compiler
- Source files centrally
- Depends centrally

dtest
- Get laptop changes, no more time function calls

General
- Move away from printf etc to out.
- It's a bit annoying that SetMaxThreads() gets called once with 0
  automatically, once with 1 from dtest.  So lots of debug text files
  are created.  Probably generate at the end, like with TimerList.
- mingw has undefined symbols, eliminate system defines as
- much as possible.
