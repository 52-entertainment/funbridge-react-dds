Move away from SolveBoard_*.cpp to System.cpp
- Move Init.cpp (ncores, kilobytesfree) to System

Death to all ifdef's that are not for debug and timing

Scheduler.cpp and .h

Timer functions do not go by _WIN32 alone
- _WIN32: Yes
- __CYGWIN__
- MAC
- __MINGW32__, maybe also __MINGW64__?

- Check all _WIN32
- Same structure as usual: Boost, OpenMP, ...

On laptop, fold dtest timing functions back into dtest

Use SetThreading() from dtest and itest
Read from *test command line, recognize right number
