Do we need System: Init and Run, or can we combine?

Cygwin works on laptop for Solve with boost, openmp, basic.
VC++ does not compile with boost version, try 14.1?
mingw has undefined symbols, eliminate system defines as
much as possible.
Move Init.cpp (ncores, kilobytesfree) to System
Localize the boost warnings from the Makefile to System.cpp list

Timer functions do not go by _WIN32 alone
- _WIN32: Yes
- __CYGWIN__
- MAC
- __MINGW32__, maybe also __MINGW64__?

- Check all _WIN32
- Same structure as usual: Boost, OpenMP, ...

On laptop, fold dtest timing functions back into dtest

More modular Makefiles

Scheduler: Do a really simple user Timer like in dtest.
Timer becomes TimerList.
Timer (new) gets used in Scheduler and for debugging.
Generate output timing files first for comparison.
