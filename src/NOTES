Do we need extern int noOfThreads in System at all?

Do we need System: Init and Run, or can we combine?

Do we need System globals at all?

mingw has undefined symbols, eliminate system defines as
much as possible.

Localize the boost warnings from the Makefile to System.cpp list

Scheduler.cpp and .h

On laptop, fold dtest timing functions back into dtest

More modular Makefiles

Scheduler: Do a really simple user Timer like in dtest.
Timer (new) gets used in Scheduler and for debugging.

Move away from printf etc to out.

It's a bit annoying that SetMaxThreads() gets called once with 0
automatically, once with 1 from dtest.  So lots of debug text files
are created.  Probably generate at the end, like with TimerList.

Makefile: One -D for each option, all user-controlled.  Modify
System.cpp accordingly.

Eliminate portab.h?

Put now timer in System as well
